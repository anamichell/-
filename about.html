                        <p id="about-text">Hi, my name is Ana Garcia, a Texas born, cyberspace cowgirl. Growing up, the internet quickly became a safe haven where I developed keen interests such as
                            video editing, photo editing, dancing, anime, and kpop. My love for technology seeped into my educational life where I now strive for a career working in a technology-based
                            environment! I enjoy the process of solving complex problems while listening to Babymetal in the background.

                        <p id="about-text">Throughout my life, I have lived in 3 different states. In 2015, Burlington, Iowa was our first big move. Then, came a new life in Tucson, Arizona in 2017, where I began and ended my
                            high school years. Coming back to my small-town in 2021 for university was an adjustment, but thanks to my family, I was able to find my place as I began my journey of self-discovery.
